## Project Roadmap

### Phase 1: Minimal Viable Product

* [x] ~~Create an over world~~
* [x] ~~Control the char with arrow keys or wasd~~

* [ ] Interact with a different rectangle on the overworld to trigger fight sequence
* [ ] In fight there will two chars facing each other
* [ ] The bad guy will have health of 10 (does not need to be be displayed)
* [ ] The bad guy deals 1 damage
* [ ] The good guy has a health of 15
* [ ] The good guy deals between 0 and 3 damage
* [ ] Upon either char dying you restart
