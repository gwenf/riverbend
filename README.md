## Project Roadmap

### Phase 1: Minimal Viable Product

* [x] ~~create an over world~~
* [x] ~~control the char with arrow keys or wasd~~
* [x] ~~char only needs to be a rectangle~~
* [ ] interact with a different rectangle on the overworld to trigger fight sequence
* [ ] in fight there will two chars facing each other
* [ ] the bad guy will have health of 10 (does not need to be be displayed)
* [ ] the bad guy deals 1 damage
* [ ] the good guy has a health of 15
* [ ] the good guy deals between 0 and 3 damage
* [ ] upon either char dying you restart

### Phase 2: Basic gameplay and design

* [ ] upon killing the bad guy he is replaced and your health goes up
* [ ] the replacement bad guy increases in hp/atk over time
* [ ] good guy has a menu to attack/heal

### Phase 3: Expanding the game

* [ ] ???

### Phase 4: Nice to have, but not important features

* [ ] ???
